# Artis Configuration
# ====================
# This file tells artis where to find the site project.
# All site-specific settings (R2 credentials, etc.) live in the site project's .env

# Site Project Path
# -----------------
# Path to the site project folder containing:
# - artis.config.yaml (paths and settings)
# - .env (credentials and secrets)
# - user-data/ (artworks, pages, settings)
# - themes/ (custom themes)
#
# Can be absolute or relative. Use ~ for home directory.
SITE_PROJECT_PATH=~/Git/my-art-site

# For fresh artis install without a site project, comment out the above
# and artis will use its bundled content-example/
